# Instagram-bot
I created this script for my friend who have very long list request send on insta. he wanted to undo all request with going manually through all accounts.
So,

The necessary libraries you need for starting this scripts are:
1. selenium
2. instagram_private_api
3. chome web driver ver. 87

and you have make changes in file at 
uname = <ur insta user name>
pwd = <ur insta acc. password>

I'm adding webdriver incase you don't find it on web.
